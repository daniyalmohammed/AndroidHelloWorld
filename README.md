# AndroidHelloWorld

## Overview

This README provides an overview of our Android HelloWorld project, where Jinal and I worked together to create a simple Android application as a starting point to learn Java and Android Studio. In this project, we also developed a basic calculator application to apply our newfound skills.

## Project Goals

Our primary goals for this project were:

1. **Learn Java**: We wanted to get a solid grasp of Java, which is essential for Android app development.

2. **Familiarize with Android Studio**: We aimed to become comfortable with Android Studio, the official integrated development environment for Android app development.

3. **Create a Hello World App**: Our initial milestone was to create a basic "Hello World" Android app to understand the Android development workflow.

4. **Build a Basic Calculator**: As our next step, we decided to create a simple calculator application to practice more complex features in Android Studio.

## Steps Taken

Here's an overview of the steps we took to accomplish our goals:

1. **Setting Up Android Studio**: We both installed Android Studio and configured it for our development environment.

2. **Creating a New Project**: In Android Studio, we created a new Android project, selecting the appropriate settings and templates for our Hello World app.

3. **Designing the User Interface (UI)**: We designed a basic user interface for the Hello World app, including a text view and a button.

4. **Writing Java Code**: We wrote Java code to handle the button click event and display the "Hello World" message when the button was pressed.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: We tested the app on an Android emulator and debugged any issues that arose.

6. **Building the Calculator**: After successfully creating the Hello World app, we expanded our project to build a basic calculator. This involved designing a more complex UI with buttons for numbers and operators and implementing the logic to perform calculations.

7. **Enhancing Features**: We added features such as clearing the input, handling decimal points, and displaying results on the calculator.

8. **Testing and Refinement**: We thoroughly tested the calculator app, identifying and fixing any bugs or usability issues.

9. **Documentation**: Throughout the project, we documented our code and decisions to ensure clarity and ease of future development.

## What We Learned

This project was an excellent learning experience for both of us. Some key takeaways include:

- Gained a solid understanding of Java programming.

- Became proficient in using Android Studio for app development.

- Learned how to design and create user interfaces for Android apps.

- Developed problem-solving skills while working on the calculator's logic.

- Improved debugging and testing skills.

## Conclusion

Our Android HelloWorld project allowed us to kickstart our journey into Android app development, providing a foundation in Java and Android Studio. The creation of a basic calculator was a valuable hands-on exercise that allowed us to apply our knowledge and build a functional Android application.

We look forward to further exploring the world of Android development and building more complex and feature-rich apps in the future.
